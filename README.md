# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the onset of diabetes using a supervised machine learning pipeline based on patient health metrics. The workflow includes exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Build a predictive model for diabetes diagnosis.
- Understand key health indicators contributing to diabetes risk.
- Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics.

## 🔍 Workflow Overview

### 1. 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Inspected dataset structure and summary statistics.
- Visualized class distribution and feature relationships.
- Checked for missing values, zero entries, and outliers.

### 2. ⚙️ Data Preprocessing
- Replaced or imputed zeros in physiological features.
- Scaled features using normalization/standardization.
- Encoded categorical values if applicable.

### 3. 🤖 Model Training
- Split data into training and test sets.
- Trained one or more models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Performed hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV).

### 4. 📈 Evaluation
- Assessed model accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
- Generated confusion matrix and ROC-AUC curve.
- Compared different models for final selection.

### 5. 💡 Feature Importance
- Analyzed feature impact using feature importance scores and SHAP model.
- Identified key predictors such as general health, BMI and age.
